We have to create only the src directory. (Because I am working on Windows, here is the win-syntax - translate to your shell):

# in Win
md src
# in Linux
mkdir src
The following simple Java class just prints a fixed message out to STDOUT, so just write this code into srcoataHelloWorld.java.

package oata;

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
Now just try to compile and run that:

# in Win
md build\classes
# in Linux
mkdir -p ./build/classes

javac -sourcepath src -d build\classes src\oata\HelloWorld.java
java -cp build\classes oata.HelloWorld
which will result in

Hello World
